All files are compiled without any external dependencies, so the Cargo.{lock, toml} files are not included.

All task folders have test data that was given in the conditions. Also included are some additional tests:
1. Railroads: 1000 randomly generated tests:
	All tests should return "Yes",
2. Pizza: 7 handmade tests,
3. RGB Game: 3 handmade tests,
4. Digital Lab: 100 randomly generated tests:
	Correct answer for inputN.txt is resultN.txt,
5. Treasure Hunt: 3 handmade tests.


All programs accept the input.txt file by default, but when running on the console, you can change 
the readable file with one argument.
